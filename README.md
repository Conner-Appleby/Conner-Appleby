## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ my name is Conner!

## I've always been passionate about learning, and Github provides the perfect space to document my journey. My motivation comes from a desire to improve my coding skills, and create solutions that can help others. Whether it's working on beginner-friendly projects, or refining my problem-solving abilities, I see every repository as an opportunity to grow and challenge myself.
